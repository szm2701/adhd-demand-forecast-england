        "## Project Narrative\n",
        "\n",
        "This project analyses historical ADHD referral data from NHS England to evaluate statistically significant growth trends, assess indicators of service strain, and develop an interpretable predictive model to forecast future demand for ADHD assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent NHS management information reports substantial increases in ADHD referrals and individuals awaiting assessment, highlighting growing pressures on mental health services (NHS Digital, 2025). National clinical guidance emphasises the importance of timely diagnosis and access to evidence-based treatment for individuals with ADHD, underscoring the need for effective service planning and capacity management (NICE, 2018).\n",
        "\n",
        "By applying statistical analysis and supervised machine learning techniques to official NHS data, this project aims to generate evidence-based insights that may support healthcare commissioners and policy stakeholders in understanding demand trajectories and anticipating future service needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can significantly affect educational, occupational, and social functioning (NICE, 2018). Prevalence estimates suggest that approximately 3–5% of the population may meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD, indicating substantial potential demand for assessment services (UK Parliament Commons Library, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent NHS publications report increasing numbers of individuals awaiting ADHD assessments and rising referral volumes year-on-year, raising concerns regarding service capacity and long waiting times (NHS Digital, 2025). The Independent ADHD Taskforce has further highlighted systemic pressures within diagnostic pathways and the need for improved planning and resource allocation (NHS England, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these developments, quantitative analysis of referral trends and waiting indicators is essential to determine whether observed increases are statistically significant and whether current trajectories suggest sustained or escalating service strain. This project seeks to contribute to that understanding through structured statistical analysis and predictive modelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "**Primary Objective**\n",
        "\n",
        "To analyse historical ADHD referral demand in England, evaluate service strain indicators, and develop a predictive model to forecast future assessment demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Secondary Objectives**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Identify whether ADHD referral volumes have increased significantly over time.\n",
        "- Compare referral levels and growth trends across age groups.\n",
        "- Analyse long-wait referral categories as indicators of system strain.\n",
        "- Develop and evaluate a supervised machine learning model to forecast referral demand.\n",
        "- Design an interactive dashboard to communicate insights clearly to healthcare stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Research Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research question 1:** Has ADHD referral demand increased significantly over time in England between April 2019 and February 2024?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research question 2:** Do mean open ADHD referral counts differ significantly across age groups in England?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research question 3:** Has the proportion of ADHD referrals waiting more than 52 weeks increased significantly over time?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research question 4:** Can future ADHD referral demand be predicted with acceptable forecasting accuracy using supervised machine learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis Testing Framework\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Hypothesis 2 – Age Group Differences  \n",
        "H₁: There is a statistically significant difference in mean open ADHD referral counts across age groups.  \n",
